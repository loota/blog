What to comment

Commit logs are mostly used when trying to get an overview about changes and
when searching for the cause of problems. Therefore comment about the reasons
for the change and summarize the change. It is not important to describe the
code changes accurately since there is a possibility to see a diff of the
commit.

Summary, compact

Summarize the commit in 50 characters. If there's more you wish to comment
insert an empty line and then add detailed description.  A short summary is
important because it makes it easier to browse logs of commits. A human being
can effectively use only a little amount of display space and many tools show
logs in a compact fashion.

Issue tracking

Issue trackers often integrate with version control systems via commit comments
and they usually require an id of an issue in the commit comment for this
integration to work. Even if there isn't this kind of integration, adding an
issue tracker id in the commit comment helps to make the change more traceable.

Tense

In commit comments, present tense is often the favored form.

Example of a good commit comment:

"Add check for configuration file not existing

The user could remove the configuration file and the program would then crash
during startup. The crash message included sensitive information and was a
security vulnerability."
