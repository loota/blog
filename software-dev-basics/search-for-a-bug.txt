Search with at least a few keywords using the issue tracker search. Good keyword
choices are parts of error messages, names of components and verbs describing
what you were trying to do.

Check logs for similar error messages and try to search for those.

Search the version control history. Commit comments and branch names might
contain keywords that the bug tracker doesn't.

Also try other information sources, wikis, emails, instant message history and
files on shared network drives.

Asking around is probably one of the most efficient methods of finding possible
previous bugs even though it will interrupt other team members and take some of
their time. However, not finding the required information might take more of
your and their time in the future.
