Automatic tests, both unit and functional, are great. They make your goals clear
and help with your development and are probably the cheapest way to do
regression testing. Yet you can waste enormous amounts of time by trying to make
them test everything right away, particularly with hard to test legacy systems. 
Kent Beck says in TDD that in one case he wrote four tests where a human
professional tester wrote more than seventy.
