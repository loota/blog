Using advanced features make code editing much more comfortable, faster and
safer. Try to find out about the capabilities of your code editor. Some of the
advanced features editors provide are:

 * indent a visually selected range
 * commenting a visually selected range
 * deleting a line
 * deleting a string inside quotation marks
 * searching for a string under cursor
 * searching with a regex
 * searching and replacing
 * completing a partial symbol
 * jumping to the definition of a class or a method
 * refactoring, that is, completely changing the design of code to another one,
   yet preserving its behavior
