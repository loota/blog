Finding a minimal test case

This is something that someone will probably have to do anyway at some point and it
is often easiest when the problem and the situation is fresh in your mind.
Many problems surface far from where they really originate. Try to isolate the
cause, trying just a few of the first or last steps you used. Leave out some
optional steps. Use different data. Be creative.
