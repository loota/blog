Try at least a few keywords in the bug tracker search.

Try to look at version control history. Commit comments might contain keywords
that the bug tracker doesn't.

Also try other information sources, like wikis and files on shared network drives.

Asking around will interrupt other team members and take some of their time, but
not finding the required information might take more of their time.
