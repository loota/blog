Estimates are very important even though they often are not accurate. They
are almost always much better than nothing.

Slice the work into smaller parts and try to estimate these separately.

Use data from earlier work to see how long similar tasks have taken and
use that as the base for the estimate.

If the estimate is difficult, try to at least estimate a range. "3 to 10 hours" is a
much better estimate than "I have no idea".

You can also use software designed to help with estimation.

Estimating skills improve with practise. Observe how accurate the estimates
have been and refine your estimates.
